    Download a .txt file associated with a given digest ID.

    This function searches for a `.txt` file in a directory corresponding to the provided
    digest ID. If a file is found, it is read and returned as a downloadable attachment.
    If no `.txt` file is found, an error is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    digest_id : str
        The unique identifier for the digest. It is used to find the corresponding directory
        and locate the .txt file within that directory.

    Returns
    -------
    Response
        A FastAPI Response object containing the content of the found `.txt` file. The file is
        sent with the appropriate media type (`text/plain`) and the correct `Content-Disposition`
        header to prompt a file download.

    Raises
    ------
    HTTPException
        If the digest directory is not found or if no `.txt` file exists in the directory.
